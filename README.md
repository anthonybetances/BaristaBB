## Barista BB

This web app allows the cashier user to submit orders to the server side.  Baristas can log in, see the queue in order of submission, and check off queue items as they're completed, thereby moving them to the "finished" list.  They can delete finished items, or remove items from the queue in case of any mistakes.
